# React Native JSON Web Token Client App

##### App by Nick West. Email Nick at mail@nickwe.st

This React Native JWT client app uses the [Axios HTTP client library](https://github.com/axios/axios) for HTTP requests.

#### Install & Run

* `cd React-Native-Client`
* Install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm i`
* Run in simulator or connected device with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

#### Notes

* The example HTTP requests contained in this app use HTTP rather than HTTPS. In order to push an app to production in any app store, your app may only make requests to a secured HTTPS endpoint.
* In order to properly run this app, you should have both the `react-native-cli` and `react-native` npm packages installed globally.
* Install [**yarn package manager**](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) to use in place of npm commands if you have not already.
